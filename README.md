# Game Jam Spring 2023
Game Jam for Spring 2023!

To start developing, first ensure you have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and then run `git clone https://github.com/michael-mcgovern2/GameJamS23.git`. Then, in Unity Hub, open a new project from disk and select the GameJamS23 directory that now exists within the directory you executed the `git clone`.
